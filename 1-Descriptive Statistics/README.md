# 📊 Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics** helps us describe data in a short and meaningful way.

Instead of listing every value individually, we summarize data using key measures like **mean, median, mode**, and **spread (variance, standard deviation)**.

## 🔹 Types of Descriptive Statistics

### 1️⃣ Measures of Central Tendency

Tell us **where the center of data lies**.

#### Mean (Average)

* **Formula:**

```text
Mean (\u03BC) = Sum of all values / Number of values
```

* **Example:**

```
Marks = 60, 70, 80
Mean = (60 + 70 + 80)/3 = 210/3 = 70
```

* **Note:** Affected by extreme values (outliers)

#### Median (Middle Value)

* Middle value when data is sorted
* **Example:**

```
Marks = 40, 50, 60, 90, 100
Median = 60
```

* **Note:** Not affected by extreme values
* **When to use:** Skewed data like income, house prices

#### Mode (Most Frequent Value)

* Value that appears most frequently in the dataset
* **Example:**

```
Marks = 40, 50, 50, 60, 70
Mode = 50
```

### 2️⃣ Measures of Dispersion (Spread)

Tell us **how spread out data is**.

* **Variance** – Average of squared differences from the mean
* **Standard Deviation** – Square root of variance (spread in same units as data)
