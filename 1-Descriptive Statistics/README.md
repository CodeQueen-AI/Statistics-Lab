# 📊 Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics** helps us describe data in a short and meaningful way

Instead of listing every value individually, we summarize data using key measures like **mean** and **median**


## 🔹 Measures of Central Tendency

Tell us **where the center of data lies**

### Mean (Average)

* **Formula:**

```text
Mean (\u03BC) = Sum of all values / Number of values
```


* **Note:** Affected by extreme values (outliers)

### Median (Middle Value)

* Middle value when data is sorted


* **Note:** Not affected by extreme values
* **When to use:** Skewed data like income, house prices
