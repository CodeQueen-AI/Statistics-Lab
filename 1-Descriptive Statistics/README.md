# 📊 Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics** helps us describe data in a short and meaningful way.

Instead of listing every value individually, we summarize data using key measures like **mean** and **median**.

## 🔹 Measures of Central Tendency

Tell us **where the center of data lies**.

### Mean (Average)

* **Formula:**

```text
Mean (\u03BC) = Sum of all values / Number of values
```

* **Example:**

```
Marks = 60, 70, 80
Mean = (60 + 70 + 80)/3 = 210/3 = 70
```

* **Note:** Affected by extreme values (outliers)

### Median (Middle Value)

* Middle value when data is sorted
* **Example:**

```
Marks = 40, 50, 60, 90, 100
Median = 60
```

* **Note:** Not affected by extreme values
* **When to use:** Skewed data like income, house prices
