## 🧠 **Types of Statistics**

Statistics is mainly divided into **2 types**


## **1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics**

**Descriptive Statistics** is also called Simple Statistics

### 📌 Definition:

* It **describes and summarizes data**
* It does **not make predictions or decisions**



### 🔹 **Common Concepts in Descriptive Statistics**

* **Mean** : Average of the data
* **Median** : Middle value of the data
* **Mode** : Most frequent value
* **Variance** : Measure of how data spreads
* **Standard Deviation** : Spread of data in original units



### 📌 **Example**

* Finding **average marks** of students
* Finding **highest and lowest marks**



## **2️⃣ Inferential Statistics**

**Inferential Statistics** is used to make conclusions about a population using a sample

### 📌 Definition:

* It does more than just describing data
* It helps in decision-making and predictions


### 🔹 **Common Concepts in Inferential Statistics**

* Probability
* Random Variables
* Probability Distributions
* Sampling
* Hypothesis Testing
* Confidence Intervals

### 📌 **Example**

Using marks of **some students (sample)** to estimate the average marks of the whole class (population)



## 🔁 **Quick Comparison**

| Descriptive Statistics | Inferential Statistics          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Describes data         | Makes decisions and predictions |
| Mean, Median, Mode     | Probability, Hypothesis Testing |
| No predictions         | Predictions and inference       |



## ❓ **Why Statistics is Important?**

Statistics helps us to:

* Understand data
* Organize data
* Summarize data
* Find meaning from data

### ✔ Simple definition:

> Statistics = Understanding the story in data 📊


## 🌍 **Real-Life Example**

Class marks: **40, 50, 60, 80, 90**

Questions:

* Who is the best student?
* Is the class strong or weak?
* What is the average performance?

> These questions are **difficult without statistics**


## 📌 **What Statistics Tells Us**

* Average marks
* Middle (median) marks
* How much marks vary (spread)


## 🎯 **Why Do We Use Statistics?**

Statistics is used in:

* 📚 Analyzing students’ marks
* 🏥 Hospitals (patient data)
* 🛒 Business (sales data)
* 📱 Apps (user behavior)
* 📊 Data Analytics & Data Science

> Wherever there is data, statistics is used
