## 📌 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

In simple words:

> Statistics helps us understand data and make sense of numbers.

## 🧠 Types of Statistics

Statistics is mainly divided into **two types**:

---

## 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics (Simple Statistics)

**Descriptive Statistics** is also called **Simple Statistics**.

👉 It is used to **describe and summarize data**.
👉 It does **not** make predictions or decisions.

### 🔹 Common concepts in Descriptive Statistics

* **Mean** – Average of the data
* **Median** – Middle value of the data
* **Mode** – Most frequent value
* **Variance** – Measure of data spread
* **Standard Deviation** – Spread of data in easy units

### 📌 Example

Finding the average marks of students or the highest and lowest values in a dataset.

## 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics

**Inferential Statistics** is used to **draw conclusions about a population using sample data**.

👉 It goes beyond just describing data.
👉 It helps in decision‑making and predictions.

### 🔹 Common concepts in Inferential Statistics

* Probability
* Random Variables
* Probability Distributions
* Sampling
* Hypothesis Testing
* Confidence Intervals

### 📌 Example

Using marks of some students (sample) to estimate the average marks of all students (population).
