## 📌 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing and interpreting data

In simple words:

> Statistics helps us understand data and make sense of numbers


## 🧠 Types of Statistics

Statistics is mainly divided into Two Types:


## 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics 

Descriptive Statistics is also called Simple Statistics

👉 It is used to describe and summarize data
👉 It does not make predictions or decisions

### 🔹 Common concepts in Descriptive Statistics

* **Mean** – Average of the data
* **Median** – Middle value of the data
* **Mode** – Most frequent value
* **Variance** – Measure of data spread
* **Standard Deviation** – Spread of data in easy units

### 📌 Example

Finding the average marks of students or the highest and lowest values in a dataset


## 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics

**Inferential Statistics** is used to draw conclusions about a population using sample data

👉 It goes beyond just describing data
👉 It helps in decision‑making and predictions

### 🔹 Common concepts in Inferential Statistics

* Probability
* Random Variables
* Probability Distributions
* Sampling
* Hypothesis Testing
* Confidence Intervals

### 📌 Example

Using marks of some students (sample) to estimate the average marks of all students (population)



## 🔁 Quick Comparison

| Descriptive Statistics | Inferential Statistics          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Describes data         | Makes decisions using data      |
| Mean, Median, Mode     | Probability, Hypothesis Testing |
| No prediction          | Prediction & inference          |



Statistics kya hoti hai?

Statistics ek aisa subject hai jo humein numbers (data) ko
👉 samajhne,
👉 organize karne,
👉 summarize karne,
👉 aur meaning nikalne me madad karta hai.

Simple words me:

Statistics = data se kahani samajhna 📊

Real-life example se samjho

Socho tumhari class me 5 students ke marks hain:

40, 50, 60, 80, 90

Ab socho:

Kaun sa student best hai?

Class overall achi hai ya weak?

Average performance kya hai?

👉 Ye sawal statistics ke baghair mushkil hote.

Statistics humein batati hai:

Average marks

Beech ka mark

Marks kitne zyada upar-neeche hain

Statistics hum kyun use karte hain?

Statistics ka use hota hai:

📚 Students ke marks analyze karne

🏥 Hospitals me patients ka data

🛒 Business me sales samajhne

📱 Apps me users ka behavior

📊 Data Analytics & Data Science

👉 Matlab jahan data hai, wahan statistics hai.

Statistics ke 2 main types hote hain
1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

👉 Jo data ko sirf describe karti hai

Example:

Average marks = 60

Highest score = 90

Isme aata hai:

Mean

Median

Mode

Variance

Standard Deviation

2️⃣ Inferential Statistics

👉 Jo data dekh kar future ka andaza lagati hai

Example:

“Is sample se lagta hai ke poori population ka average 65 hoga”

(Isme probability, hypothesis testing waghera aata hai — baad me)

One-line yaad rakhne ka formula 🧠

Statistics = Data ko samajhne ka science
